            This website was my first attempt in recreating a design while using
            my acquired knowledge and the research I've done. It was created as
            a test of my skills to build a website from scratch; the design was
            influenced by several real estate websites, and I used the best
            parts of their concepts.

            Phoodie is a culinary recipe website created as part of a group
            project for an academic requirement. I am the project's lead
            programmer, and the website was developed collaboratively. The
            difficulty I experienced when constructing this website was the
            distribution of various duties for my teammates; we all have
            different ways of writing our own program, thus the process of
            integration requires a lot of work to get the desired result.Aside
            from my work as a lead programmer, I implemented data manipulation
            using XAMPP and PHP, and I converted the design into an actual
            website using HTML5, CSS3, and Javascript.

            Lakbai is a travel website created as part of a group project for an
            academic requirement. I am also the project's lead programmer, and
            the website was developed collaboratively. This website displays
            tourist locations in the Philippines, as well as an estimate of the
            entire cost of travel and dining costs. It also displays the
            geolocation of the tourist attraction so that visitors may easily
            reach it. The website's functionality is CRUD (create, read, update,
            and delete), and there are three user levels: the administrator, who
            supervises tourist places and lower user levels; the user, who can
            create reviews for tours; and the non-user, who may browse the
            website but with limited functionality.
